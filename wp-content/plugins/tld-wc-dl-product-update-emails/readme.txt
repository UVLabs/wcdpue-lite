== Description ==

A simple plugin used to send emails to customers who bought a downloadable product, letting them know that there's been an update to their download. Never let customers guess if an edition of the e-book they bought has been updated. No more need to manually email customers about downloadable product updates or creating a new product.

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
